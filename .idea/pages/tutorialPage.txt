This is the websites tutorial page for learners.

This page contains a list / grid of tiles

Each has a title, difficulty level, set of language/framework tags and a header image

These tiles are all links to dedicated pages for each tutorial

There are dropdowns to sort by tags and a search bar that looks through titles

There are a mix of videos, articles and practical challenges

Practical challenges have links to github repos for users to upload and compare their work via pull requests

These github repos can be cloned to download templates for the challenges
